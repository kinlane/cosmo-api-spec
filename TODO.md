# TODO

* Support dryrun mode
* Add version support to the blueprint
* Add version to the API itself
* Diffs
  - b/w desired and current state
  - b/w versions of state
  - b/w current state and an external yml spec (not loaded yet)
* Metadata API (version, uptime etc)
* Metrics API. E.g. how to monitor each service - or the monitoring data itself...
